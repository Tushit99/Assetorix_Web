                    Acquiring and disposing of the right assets (at the right time) is a critical step in enhancing investment return. Sometimes properties that appear similar on paper can perform differently in the marketplace. Advertised sales prices do not always adequately reflect a thorough understanding of the property and its current or potential value, making our unsurpassed local market knowledge and deep experience in the investment arena an indispensable component of any effective acquisition or disposition strategy. We understand the many factors that influence land values and site selection including supply and demand, zoning, demographic, traffic patterns, and political issues.
